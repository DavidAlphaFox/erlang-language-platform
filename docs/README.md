# Documentation about ELP

This currently just has a doodle about some possible internal
organisation of ELP and related components.

## Updating the excalidraw diagrams

Use https://excalidraw.thefacebook.com/
Load the file, then export as svg or png.

## Working on Markdown

I find it useful to install the [Markdown Preview
Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)
extension in VsCode @ FB, enable preview on the file (CMD-shift-v),
and leave it in the background while editing in emacs. It updates live
when you save.

One thing it does not do is reflow text, but that is fine while
working on a draft.
